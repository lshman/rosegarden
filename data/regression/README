The files in this directory are short and simple regression test files.  When
adding new regression tests to this directory, please document their purpose in
this file.

The unittest lilypond_export_test runs all these, just type 'ctest' in the builddir to
run all unittests.


export_hidden_key_signatures.rg
-------------------------------
I discovered that I introduced a bug in revision 8693 whereby my attempt at
preventing hidden key signatures from exporting actually broke the spelling of
exported LilyPond notes in a painful way.  This file should export with all
leter notes having -is suffixes (fis, cis, dis, gis) in the key of E major, with
only one key signature printed.
